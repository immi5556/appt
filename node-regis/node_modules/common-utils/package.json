  "readme": "# Common Utils\n\nThis package implements a number of pure JavaScript utility modules useful for server side development. It can be used with [all engines](http://wiki.commonjs.org/wiki/Implementations) implementing the  CommonJS [Modules/1.1](http://wiki.commonjs.org/wiki/Modules/1.1) and [Packages/1.0](http://wiki.commonjs.org/wiki/Packages/1.0) specifications. Common Utils strives to provide the fastest, leanest cross platform utilities implementation, so the code size is kept to a minimum while performance is optimized with the help of extensive benchmarks. The following modules are included:\n\n* base64 - Base 64 encoding and decoding\n* md5 - MD5 hashing\n\n### Usage\n\nFirst install the package via npm:\n\n    npm install common-utils\n    \nTo use the package in your module:\n\n    var decode = require('common-utils/base64').decode;\n    \nFor all the available modules and exports, check out the [documentation](http://oleg.github.com/common-utils/doc/). More info on how to use `require` is available in the [Node.js documentation](http://nodejs.org/docs/v0.5.5/api/modules.html).\n\n\n### Tests\n\nYou will need to globally install [common-node](http://oleg.github.com/common-node/) via npm to run the tests.\n\nTo run the unit tests:\n\n    node test/all.js\n\nYou can also run individual tests, for example:\n\n \tnode test/base64.js\n     \n### Benchmarks\n\nBenchmarks will be added to `/benchmarks`\n\n### Contributing\n\nTo contribute to this project, you can start by trying to run the tests on your system and posting any failures on the issue tracker. It is advised that you use the version in master for doing this, which you can install via:\n\n    npm install -g https://github.com/olegp/common-utils/tarball/master\n\nIf you run into any issues along the way, whether related to using this library\nin your own project or to the documentation, please post your comments on the [issue tracker](https://github.com/olegp/common-utils/issues/). The tracker is also a great place to contribute ideas and find out what needs doing.\n\nTo find specific issues not listed on the tracker, you can run the following command from inside the `common-utils` directory.\n\n    grep 'TODO' lib/*  \n\nTo contribute code: fork the project, make and commit your changes and send a pull request.\n\nModules currently planned for includes are listed on the [wiki](http://github.com/olegp/common-utils/wiki/).\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\n  * [dsowsy](https://github.com/dsowsy) for pointing out that base64 needs to be refactored out of `common-node`\n    \n### License \n\n(The MIT License)\n\nCopyright (c) 2011 Oleg Podsechin\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining\na copy of this software and associated documentation files (the\n'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to\npermit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to\nthe following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED 'AS IS', WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.\nIN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY\nCLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT,\nTORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE\nSOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.",
